# Emaar Development DCF Valuation

## Objective  
This project was built as part of my learning journey in financial modeling and to apply valuation methods to my own investing.  
The goal was to develop a **complete Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model** for Emaar Development PJSC, one of Dubai’s leading real estate developers, and to explore how different assumptions affect valuation.  

## Methodology  
- **Revenue Forecasting**: based on the company’s record project backlog, not flat growth rates.  
- **Margin Adjustment**: normalized operating margins after an exceptional 2023.  
- **WACC Build-Up**: constructed bottom-up (risk-free rate, ERP, beta, cost of debt).  
- **Working Capital (BFR) Modeling**: receivables, inventory (slow turnover), and payables modeled explicitly, reflecting real estate cycles.  
- **Scenario Analysis**: base, conservative, and optimistic cases.  
- **Sensitivity Tables**: WACC vs terminal growth.  
- **Peer Multiples**: cross-check vs global peers (EV/EBITDA, P/E).  

## Results  
- WACC: **5.59%**, Terminal Growth: **1.0%**.  
- Intrinsic value per share: ~**€6.60** vs current price ~**€3.73**.  
- Upside potential: **+77%** in the base case.  
- Free cash flows: negative during expansion years (2025–2027, due to inventory build-up), turning positive from 2028 onwards as projects are delivered.  
- Sensitivity analysis: upside ranges from **-19% to +110%** depending on WACC (5.6%–12.4%) and terminal growth (0.5%–2.0%).  
- Multiples check: Emaar trades at unusually low levels vs global peers (EV/EBITDA ~2.7x, P/E ~6.5x vs 8–12x).  

## Learnings  
- In real estate, **inventory turnover and working capital** are the most critical drivers of valuation.  
- DCF outputs are only credible when **assumptions move consistently** (sales, margins, CAPEX, BFR).  
- Large upside results should always be challenged with **sensitivity tests and peer multiples**.
